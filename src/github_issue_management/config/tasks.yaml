monitor_issues:
  description: |-
    Monitor the GitHub repository {repository} for new issues.
    Use the get_new_issues tool to fetch recent open issues that haven't been processed yet.
    Provide a detailed summary of each new issue including:
    - Issue number and title
    - Full issue body/content
    - Current labels (if any)
    - Current assignees (if any)
    - Creation date
    - Issue URL
    
    Focus on issues that don't have labels or assignees yet, as these need processing.
    Format the output clearly so that other agents can easily parse the issue information.
  expected_output: |-
    A detailed report listing all new issues found, including:
    - Total number of new issues
    - For each issue: number, title, body, labels, assignees, created_at, URL
    - Issues that need processing (missing labels or assignees)
    Format: Use clear section headers and bullet points for readability.
  agent: issue_monitor

label_issues:
  description: |-
    Analyze each new issue from the monitoring task and determine appropriate labels.
    Based on the issue's title and body content, classify it as one or more of:
    - bug: For bug reports, errors, crashes, unexpected behavior, or "not working" issues
    - feature-request: For new feature requests, "add", "implement", "new feature" requests
    - documentation: For documentation updates, improvements, clarifications, or "docs" related issues
    - question: For questions, support requests, or "how to" inquiries
    - enhancement: For improvements to existing features
    
    Analyze keywords and context carefully. An issue can have multiple labels if appropriate.
    Use the add_label_to_issue tool to apply labels to each issue.
    Provide clear reasoning for each label assignment based on the issue content.
    Only label issues that don't already have labels, or add missing labels to partially labeled issues.
  expected_output: |-
    A report showing:
    - Each issue analyzed (with issue number and title)
    - Labels assigned to each issue with detailed reasoning
    - Confirmation that labels were successfully applied via the tool
    Format: Use clear section headers and bullet points.
  agent: labeler
  context:
    - monitor_issues

assign_issues:
  description: |-
    Based on the labeled issues and team member expertise information ({team_members}),
    assign appropriate team members to each issue.
    
    Consider:
    - Issue labels (bug, feature-request, documentation, etc.)
    - Technical domain required (frontend, backend, DevOps, documentation, etc.)
    - Issue content and keywords that indicate the domain (e.g., "UI", "API", "deploy", "docs")
    - Team member expertise areas from {team_members}
    - Issue complexity and workload distribution
    
    Match issues to experts:
    - Frontend issues (UI, React, CSS, JavaScript, browser) → frontend team members
    - Backend issues (API, database, server, Python, Node.js) → backend team members
    - DevOps issues (deployment, CI/CD, infrastructure, Docker, Kubernetes) → DevOps team members
    - Documentation issues → documentation team members
    
    Use the assign_issue tool to assign team members.
    Only assign to issues that don't already have assignees, or add additional assignees if needed.
    Provide clear reasoning for each assignment decision.
  expected_output: |-
    A report showing:
    - Each issue that was assigned (with issue number and title)
    - Team members assigned to each issue with detailed reasoning
    - Confirmation that assignments were successfully made via the tool
    Format: Use clear section headers and bullet points.
  agent: assigner
  context:
    - monitor_issues
    - label_issues

assess_issues:
  description: |-
    Provide initial assessment comments for each new issue.
    
    For bug reports (labeled as "bug"):
    - Analyze the issue description carefully
    - If reproduction steps are missing, suggest clear numbered reproduction steps
    - Identify potential root causes based on the description
    - Recommend debugging approaches and investigation steps
    - Format: Use markdown headers, code blocks, and bullet points
    
    For feature requests (labeled as "feature-request"):
    - Evaluate the feature proposal and its value
    - Provide implementation suggestions with technical considerations
    - Discuss potential challenges and alternative approaches
    - Suggest breaking down into smaller tasks if complex
    - Format: Use markdown headers, code blocks, and bullet points
    
    For documentation issues (labeled as "documentation"):
    - Identify what documentation is needed or missing
    - Suggest documentation structure and organization
    - Provide guidance on content and examples
    - Suggest where the documentation should be located
    - Format: Use markdown headers, code blocks, and bullet points
    
    For questions (labeled as "question"):
    - Provide helpful answers or guidance
    - Point to relevant documentation if available
    - Suggest next steps
    
    Use the comment_on_issue tool to add assessment comments.
    Format all comments using markdown for better readability.
    Make comments professional, helpful, and actionable.
  expected_output: |-
    A report showing:
    - Each issue that received an assessment comment (with issue number and title)
    - Summary of the assessment provided for each issue
    - Confirmation that comments were successfully added via the tool
    Format: Use clear section headers and bullet points.
